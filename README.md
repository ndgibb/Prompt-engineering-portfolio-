Focus: Home Maintenance, Mechanical Repair & Real-World Troubleshooting  

I'm a hands-on problem solver turned prompt engineer, building AI instructions from experience with tools, home systems, and real-world fixes. I have experience and skills in plumbing, electric, carpentry and mechanical maintenance. My goal: make AI more useful to homeowners, DIYers, and technicians.

#### 1. **Appliance Troubleshooting Prompts**  
*Identify issues with home systems and suggest logical test paths.*

**Prompt Example**:  
*"A refrigerator runs constantly but doesnâ€™t cool. Provide a diagnostic flow beginning with simple fixes.#

 -This is most likely a leaking compressor. First check and clean the coil filter located at the bottom of the fridge. remove the cover which usually can be snapped off. Then the best cleaning method is to use air to blow out the filter or try vacuuming. Next turn off the refridgerator for approximately 15 minutes and let the compressor cool to see if that resolves the issue.*
 
#### 2. **DIY Repair Walkthroughs**  

**Prompt Example**:  
*"A toilet is running and will not shut off."*

-This is either a fill valve or a flush valve. The Fill valve is the float inside the toilet which rises and falls with the water level.  This can be bought separately and changed by removing the plastic nut underneath the tank. Using a pair of channel locks or pliers works best. The fill valve also has an adjustment screw that controls the water level. This can be adjusted with a screw driver. You do not want the water level too high in the tank which may cause the problem. 
-The flush valve is usually some kind of a stopper that allows the water to drain from the tank. Check to make sure there is no debris around the lip of the valve which can stop a tight seal. These can also be replaced separately. Both valves can be bought as a kit at any hardware store.

#### 3. **Preventive Maintenance Checklists**  
*Build routines that extend lifespan of common appliances and systems.*

**Prompt Example**:  
*"Design a seasonal maintenance checklist for a gas water heater and furnace combo. Include safety steps, part inspection points, and efficiency tips."*

-regular filter changes based on the life of the filter usually a 1 to 3 month timeframe.
-check for any water around the bottom of the water heater
-keep the water heater clean from dirt and dust. sometimes dust buildup can happen around the pilot light which can be cleaned by vacuuming or blowing air at the bottom of the water heater. This requires that you shut the gas off and remove the cover and should most likely performed by a license plumber.
-check your carbon monoxide alarm which is necessary for detecting if your water heater or furnace has a venting issue. make sure the alarm is in good working order.*

#### 4. **Emergency Fix Response Prompts**  
*Empower quick thinking during leaks, clogs, outages, or HVAC failures.*

**Prompt Example**:  
*"Water is leaking from under a kitchen sink.  Rank the most probable causes by likelyhood and safety of the DIY repair, how to temporarily stop water damage overnight, and how to determine if a plumber is needed."*

-first check that the valves under the sink are completely closed. If you have a gatevalve check to make sure the nut is tightened. These sometimes get loose over time
-Look for any dripping water around the drain pipes.
-tighten the water supply lines
-check for water at the base of the sink well. There is a gasket that may be failing.
-check the wall and floor behind the sink thoroughly. There may be a leak coming from the vent which could be a roof leak somewhere.
#### 5. **Material & Tool Selection**  
*Help users pick reliable, safe, and cost-effective solutions.*

**Prompt Example**:  
*"Suggest adhesive options for bonding plexiglass to aluminum outdoors. Rate them based on durability, UV resistance, drying time, and user-friendliness."*
-silicone is the best option for bonding metal to plastic
