Focus: Home Maintenance, Mechanical Repair & Real-World Troubleshooting  

I'm a hands-on problem solver turned prompt engineer, building AI instructions from experience with tools, home systems, and real-world fixes. I have experience and skills in plumbing, electric, carpentry and mechanical maintenance. My goal: make AI more useful to homeowners, DIYers, and technicians. I base my prompts on the experience I have gain through my career and proven techniques I have learned using my hands-on approach in my personal life.

####  **Appliance Troubleshooting Prompts**  
*Identify issues with home systems and suggest logical test paths.*

**Prompt Example:**
"A refrigerator runs constantly but doesnâ€™t cool. Generate a step-by-step diagnostic process focusing on simple DIY checks first, followed by advanced issues that require a technician."
- Organize findings in a **numbered list** format.
- Highlight **DIY-safe solutions** vs. those needing professional repair.
- Include **risk factors or warning signs** before escalating to complex fixes.Provide a diagnostic flow beginning with simple fixes.#

1. First check and clean the filter located at the bottom of the fridge. Remove the cover which usually can be snapped off.
2. Then the best cleaning method is to use air to blow out the filter or try vacuuming. You want to clean under the refrigerator as much as possible.   
3. Check the air filter if there is one and make sure any items in the refrigerator are not blocking air flow. Sometimes it can be too full if on the shelf next to the filter.
4. Next turn off the refrigerator for approximately 15 minutes and let the compressor cool and then turn back on to see if it is an over heating issue.  If you notice that your freezer appears more icey then turn the thermostat down so the compressor doesn't over heat.
5. This is most likely a refrigerant leak somewhere or possibly an evaporator issue which will require a technician.  
 
#### **DIY Repair Walkthroughs**  
## ðŸš½ Toilet Repair Walkthrough  

Follow these steps to diagnose and fix a **running toilet** that won't shut off.

### Step 1: Shut Off the Water  
- Locate the water valve under the toilet and turn it **clockwise** to shut off the flow.

### Step 2: Check the Flush Valve  
- Inspect the stopper mechanismâ€”this controls water draining from the tank.  
- Ensure thereâ€™s no debris preventing a tight seal.  
- Look for wear, such as **cracks or thinning material**. Replace if necessary.

### Step 3: Check the Fill Valve  
- The float device should rise with the water level.  
- If it fails to rise **fully**, itâ€™s likely defective and **needs to be replaced**.  
- Check the water levelâ€”the float contains a **plastic screw** that can be adjusted with a screwdriver. Lowering the level **may resolve the issue**.  
- Replace the **fill valve**:
  1. Drain the tank by flushing and soaking up excess water.
  2. Remove the **plastic nut** under the tank with channel locks.
  3. Detach the **fill hose**, which easily slides on and off.
  4. Install the new fill valve and reconnect components.

### ðŸ”§ **Final Check**  
Once installed, turn the water valve **back on** slowly and monitor the toilet.

#### **Preventive Maintenance Checklists**  
*Build routines that extend lifespan of common appliances and systems.*

**Prompt Example**:  
*"Design a seasonal maintenance checklist for a gas water heater and furnace combo. Include safety steps, part inspection points, and efficiency tips."*

1. First change the filter on your furnance regularly based on the life of the filter usually a 1 to 3 month timeframe.
2. Next check for any water around the bottom of the water heater
3. Keep the water heater clean from dirt and dust around the pilot light located at the bottom of the water heater.
4. Lastly check your carbon monoxide alarm which is necessary for detecting if your water heater or furnace has a venting issue. Make sure the alarm is in good working order.*

#### **Emergency Fix Response Prompts**  
*Empower quick thinking during leaks, clogs, outages, or HVAC failures.*

**Prompt Example**:  
*"Water is leaking from under a kitchen sink.  Rank the most probable causes by likelyhood and safety of the DIY repair, how to temporarily stop water damage overnight, and how to determine if a plumber is needed."*

1. First check that the valves under the sink are completely closed. If you have a gatevalve check to make sure the nut is tightened. These sometimes get loose over time.
2. Check for any dripping water around the drain pipes and tighten each one if needed.  You may need to replace gaskets where the trap is connected.
3. Tighten the water supply lines.
4. Check for water at the base of the sink well. There is a gasket that may be failing where the neck pipe attaches to the sink. 
5. Check the wall and floor behind the sink thoroughly. There may be a leak coming from the vent which could be a roof leak somewhere.
